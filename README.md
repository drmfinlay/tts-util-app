- Text filters for omitting certain text elements from the audio.
- A playback-on-input mode for reading letters and words as they are typed.

Building
--------

*TTS Util* can be built by importing the project into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). It can also be [built from the command-line](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline.html) with Gradle if you don't use Android Studio.

Translations
------------

Currently, this app is available in English and Chinese (Simplified).  The Chinese translation was provided by GitHub user [Mahongyin](https://github.com/1976222027).

Any help in translating this app's resource strings and/or its documentation into other languages would be appreciated.

It should be noted that translation of *TTS Util* resource strings into a given language is not required to read/synthesise text in that language using text-to-speech.  This type of language support is handled by the text-to-speech *engine*, not *TTS Util*.
